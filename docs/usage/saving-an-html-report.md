title: Saving an HTML report

Lighthouse can generate a nicely formatted HTML report with the scores and results of all audits.

```php
use Spatie\Lighthouse\Lighthouse;

Lighthouse::url('https://example.com')
    ->run()
    ->saveHtml($pathToFile);
```

This is how that report looks like in the browser.

To get the HTML, without save it to a file, simply call `html()`.

```php
use Spatie\Lighthouse\Lighthouse;

$html = Lighthouse::url('https://example.com')
    ->run()
    ->html();
```
